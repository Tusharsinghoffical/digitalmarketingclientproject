# Digital Marketing Website - Render Deployment Summary

## Deployment Configuration

This project is configured for deployment to Render with the following components:

### 1. Render Configuration (render.yaml)

The `render.yaml` file configures:
- Web service type
- Python 3.13.0 runtime
- Build command that installs dependencies and collects static files
- Start command using Gunicorn WSGI server
- Required environment variables

### 2. Dependencies (requirements.txt)

All required Python packages:
- Django 5.2.6
- Gunicorn 22.0.0 (WSGI server for production)
- Whitenoise 6.6.0 (static file serving)

### 3. Django Settings

Production-ready settings in `settings.py`:
- Static file configuration with Whitenoise
- Security settings
- Database configuration (SQLite for simplicity, can be changed for production)

## Deployment Process

### Automated Preparation

1. Run the preparation script:
   ```
   python deploy_render.py
   ```
   or on Windows:
   ```
   prepare_deploy.bat
   ```

2. This script will:
   - Verify Python and pip installation
   - Install all requirements
   - Collect static files for production

### Render Deployment

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect GitHub repository to Render
3. Render automatically uses `render.yaml` for configuration
4. Environment variables are set in Render dashboard:
   - SECRET_KEY (auto-generated for security)
   - DEBUG=False (for production)
   - ALLOWED_HOSTS (set to your domain)

### Manual Deployment (Alternative)

If you prefer manual deployment:

1. Create a new Web Service on Render
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Set these configuration values:
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py collectstatic --noinput`
   - Start Command: `gunicorn digitalmarketing.wsgi:application`
   - Environment Variables:
     - PYTHON_VERSION = 3.13.0
     - SECRET_KEY = [your secret key]
     - DEBUG = False

## Post-Deployment

After deployment, Render will:
- Automatically build and deploy your application
- Serve it at a render.com subdomain (custom domains can be added)
- Handle SSL certificates automatically
- Provide logs and monitoring through the dashboard

## Customization

To customize for your specific needs:
- Update environment variables in Render dashboard
- Modify static files in the `static/` directory
- Update templates in the `templates/` directory
- Add your own content to the various pages

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- Build failures: Check requirements.txt for missing dependencies
- Static files not loading: Verify collectstatic command in build process
- Application errors: Check Render logs for detailed error messages
- Security warnings: Set proper environment variables in Render dashboard
